breadth first: looking at each node in a level before moving on. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
nodes added to the frontier are added to a queue to be expanded

depth first: look at each node, expanding the node that you most recenlty
lookied at. 0 1 3 4 2 5 6
nodes added to the frontier are added to a stack to be expanded

Dijksra's Algorithm: as you expand the tree/map you look at the node that has
the least cost to travel to fitst.
nodes added to the frontier are added to a priority queue/heap, measuring the
total cost of reaching a node.

A*: as you expand the tree/map you look at the node that has the least of the
sum of the cost to get to the node and the estimation of reaching your
destination first.
nodes added to the frontier are added to a priority queue/heap, measuring the
total cost of reaching a node plus the estimation reaching the destination,
aka heuristic
